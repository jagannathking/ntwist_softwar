    *   Includes a CSS Grid sidebar layout responsive for mobile.
    *   Bonus: Interactive 1-5 star rating widget.

2.  **Sortable List Page (`sort.html`)**
    *   Displays a hardcoded list of names.
    *   Includes a button to sort the list alphabetically using vanilla JavaScript without page reload.

3.  **FAQ Page (`faq.html`)**
    *   Features a CSS-only accordion using the HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` elements for expand/collapse functionality.
    *   No JavaScript is used for the core accordion mechanism on this page.

## Technology Stack

*   HTML5 (Semantic)
*   CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, CSS Variables, Media Queries)
